Salary Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts employee salaries using Linear Regression. The model analyzes key factors such as years of experience, test scores, and interview performance, applying data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training to generate accurate salary predictions. Built with Python and Scikit-learn, the project demonstrates a complete and practical introduction to regression-based prediction.
